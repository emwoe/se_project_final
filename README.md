# Study Helper

This is the front-end for a full-stack app built using React. The app allows users to use search terms to find basic information about topics they want to learn about and recommendations for how to commit this information to memory. It is intended as a starting point for learning new materials and encourages users to use AI as a starting point, rather than a replacement, for learning.

# React + Vite

This project was created using React & Vite. See below for information on the template used:

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
